# TDI_SQL
MySQL database for the Tumor-specific Driver Identification (TDI) algorithm

ToDo:
  Revise functions that populate tables so that they are more flexible given differently formatted input. Also need to make them   more resistant to bad user input.
  
  Make a driver program for others in the lab that will allow them to connect to the database and perform the queries as defined   by our API.
  
  Clean and document code.
